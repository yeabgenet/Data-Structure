           Linear Search
Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found, 
otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set.

How Does Linear Search Algorithm Work?

In Linear Search Algorithm, 

Every element is considered as a potential match for the key and checked for the same.
If any element is found equal to the key, the search is successful and the index of that element is returned.
If no element is found equal to the key, the search yields “No match found”.

       Binary Search 
Binary Search is defined as a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
Conditions for when to apply Binary Search in a Data Structure:
To apply Binary Search algorithm:

The data structure must be sorted.
Access to any element of the data structure takes constant time.
